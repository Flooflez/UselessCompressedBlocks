# Useless Compressed Blocks
![Block Showcase](https://github.com/Flooflez/UselessCompressedBlocks/blob/1.19/assets/side_view.png?raw=true)
This mod adds compressed variants for 8 vanilla blocks that have no reason to be stored in bulk.

## Features
This mod adds compressed variants for the following blocks: 
1. Crafting Table
2. Fletching Table
3. Purpur Block
4. Honeycomb Block
5. Endstone Bricks
6. Note Block
7. Smooth Stone
8. Red Nether Bricks

Blocks can be compressed up to 8 times! <br>
This means you can store **43,046,721** vanilla blocks in a single compressed block! <br>
Compressed Crafting Tables work the same, but the Compressed Note Blocks have a special sound to them. 

## Crafting
To craft a compressed item, simply place 9 vanilla blocks in a 3 x 3 pattern in a crafting table.
